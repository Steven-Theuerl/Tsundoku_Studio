# Tsundoku Studio - Headless CMS

Tsundoku Studio is a custom-built headless CMS created with Sanity.io. It allows me (or any collaborator) to create structured content‚Äîsuch as blog articles, videos, or events‚Äîand deliver that content to my frontend website, Tsundoku Blog, via API.

## üß† Challenges & Learning

- Understanding Sanity‚Äôs schema design, preview customization, and structure builder API  
- Querying nested block content with GROQ to allow for article body search indexing  
- Creating dynamic filters using GROQ projections, joins, and relational mapping  
- Optimizing studio UX for content creators (grouping, validation, live previews)  
- Fixing **preview content leaking into production**: Initially struggled with Sanity‚Äôs preview mode bleeding into non-preview routes. Solved by restructuring the logic to only enable draft mode for `/api/preview` routes and adding a cookie-based system to persist preview state safely. This prevented accidental draft data exposure and now guarantees that only `/api/preview` routes or explicit `?preview=true` query params can enable draft content.
- Rewrote Sanity preview flow and routing logic to ensure that both localhost and production (tsundoku.blog) enforce this behavior consistently.
- **Studio Preview Enhancement:** I added a preview window directly into the Sanity Studio UI for contributors. While I'm comfortable juggling multiple windows across three screens, I knew that might not be the case for everyone I invited to create content. This studio-side preview made it easier for less technical users to see their updates reflected in real-time‚Äîwithout needing to switch tabs or deploy anything. It helped reduce confusion, improved workflow speed, and made Tsundoku more usable for creative collaborators.
